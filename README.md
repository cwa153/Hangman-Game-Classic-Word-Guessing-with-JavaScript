# Hangman-Game-Classic-Word-Guessing-with-JavaScript
The Classic Hangman Game is a simple, interactive word-guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The project features dynamic word generation, real-time game feedback, and a clean, responsive design. JavaScript handles the game logic — tracking guesses, updating the display, and checking win/lose conditions — while HTML and CSS create an engaging user interface. Perfect for practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game development on the web.
